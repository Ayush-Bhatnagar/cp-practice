Write a program to connect next left node in a binary tree. Also first node of each level should be pointing to last node of next level? (Without using Queue)
Given a directed graph. Construct another graph from given graph such that if path exists from vertices A to vertices B and from B to C, then path from A to C and from C to A also should exists.
Implement hashmap on your own. Write good hashing function for string.
Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. For simplicity assume there are no duplicates.
Given string s and string t find whether all permutation of t is present as substring in s.
Design a stack which holds an integer value such that getMinimum() function should return the minimum element in the stack. Implement popMin() function which would pop minimum element from the original stack.
Given an array which is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. Find an element in this array.
Given a tree with edge weights, find any path in the tree with maximum sum of edges.
Merge k sorted arrays.
This problem is know as Clock angle problem where we need to find angle between hands of an analog clock at a given time.
Examples:Input:  h = 12:00, m = 30.00 
Output: 165 degreeInput:  h = 3.00, m = 30.00 Output: 75 degree
