1. always check for unintialized vector.
  2. priority_queue<pair<int,int>,vector<pair<int,int>>,greater<pair<int,int>> > pq; for djikstra
  3. check for constrained properly
  4. 10^8 operations per second
  5. Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
  6. odd number can be expresses in sum of two prime number only if (n-2) is prime.
  7. always pass string vector everything  by reference else can get MLe TLE;
  8. An even digits of pallindromic number is always divided by 11 euler project 4th question..
   
  9. lookup in a set is logn and in a vector is n 
 10. We are given an undirected connected graph, 
     it is necessary to orient its arc so as to obtain a strongly connected directed graph.
	 There is theorem (on a theoretical basis for a written task) that a graph admits an 
	 orientation to a strongly connected digraph if and only if every edge is part of what a cycle.
	 and to find the orientation of edges just do a dfs and take all edges in the direction of dfs
	 if there is only one scc component then the graph is strongly connected
  
  If n = 12, the time complexity can be O(n!).
  If n = 25, the time complexity can be O(2n).
  If n = 100, the time complexity can be O(n4).
  If n = 500, the time complexity can be O(n3).
  If n = 10^4, the time complexity can be O(n2).
  If n = 10^6, the time complexity can be O(n log n).
  If n = 10^8, the time complexity can be O(n).
  If n > 10^8, the time complexity can be O(log n) or O(1).
