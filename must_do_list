Q12. Given an array, arrange the elements such that the number formed by concatenating the elements is highest.
	  E.g.: input = [9, 93, 24, 6],  the output should be: [9,93,6,24].  This is because if you concatenate all the numbers,   993624 is the highest number that can be formed. 
Q13. Given a string, find the longest substring which is palindrome.
Q14. Given an unsorted array of n integers which can contain integers from 1 to n. Some elements can be repeated multiple times and some other elements can be absent from the array. Count frequency of all elements that are present and print the missing elements. Examples: Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 3, 2, 5}   Output: Below are frequencies of all elements   1 -> 0        2 -> 2        3 -> 2        4 -> 0        5 -> 1 
Q15. Given two strings in lowercase, the task is to make them anagram. The only allowed operation is to remove a character from any string. Find minimum number of characters to be deleted to make both the strings anagram?
          If two strings contains same data set in any order then strings are called Anagrams.
          Examples: 
          Input : str1 = "bcadeh" str2 = "hea"   Output: 3  We need to remove b, c and d from str1. 
          Input : str1 = "cddgk" str2 = "gcd"  Output: 2 
          Input : str1 = "bca" str2 = "acb"  Output: 0
